This is a simple implementation of mnemonic seed phrase generation as described in [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).

This code is meant to be education but **not hardened for production use**. It has not been audited or thoroughly tested, and most error handling has been omitted.
